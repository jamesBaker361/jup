    "A few markets are key to the health of the economy. Autos and energy are two that most people would quickly cite. The housing market is another.  Housing data can be divided into housing permits, housing starts, new home sales, and existing home sales. In addition, housing can be viewed as single family or multifamily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing home sales (as well as new home sales) are dependent on the future, expected state of the economy. For the future state, if there is a concern that the economy will go into a recession soon, people will be less willing to buy a new home for fear of losing their job, so housing sales will be weak or decline. But if the economy looks promising, then housing sales will be strong or increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor important for the decision to buy a new home is the current mortgage rate or yield. Usually, people get a fixed rate which means they will be paying that same rate for many years, often 30 years. In essence, the mortgage rate adds to the price of a home.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will estimate a model to explain home sales as a function of the mortgage yield."
