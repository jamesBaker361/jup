Failures and liabilities were strongly positively correlated, which is logical, as failing firms lacking revenue would need debt just to cover their operating costs. On the other hand, the correlation could be purely coincedental, as both failures and debt may grow over time.*"

Ergo, those two variables would seem negatively correlated, even though neither necessarily causes the other. I would expect Total Amount of Current Liabilities to rise during expansions, as growing firms are eager to go in debt to expand, and to fall during recessions when there are fewer firms, and those firms make fewer investments.

During expansions, optimism will make entrepreneurs will be more likely to start businesses, and New Business Incorporations will increase, and it will correspondingly fall during recessions. During periods of growth, businesses will also be more likely to go into debt to finance new investments, because they will be more confident about their investments paying off, so Total Amount of Current Liabilities will increase.

A period of severe economic stress may have a small uptick of business formation due to other factors, such as population growth, or changes in fiscal or regulatory policy.

Total Amount of Current Liabilities and Total Number of Failures are also positively correlated (R=0.916073). Neither of the correlations prove causation. I theorize that over time, population increases, and thus there are more businesses opening. At the same time, I predict that over time, the real money supply also increases, and thus more loans can be made, and thus Total Amount of Current Liabilities will increase. This is only one possible explanation why these variables could appear correlated. On the contrary, there could be causal relationship. New businesses may be eager to accumulate debt for their early growth, and thus an increase in New Business Incorporations would mean an increase in liabilities. An increase in liabilities may also reflect that firms revenues are insufficient to cover their costs, and these failing firms will eventually go bankrupt due to their high debt loads, leading to an increase in Total Number of Failures. The data does not verify or falsify these theories, nor are any of them mutually exclusive."
